## Docker Setup and Usage

This project uses Docker to create a consistent and reproducible development environment. Below is a guide on how the Docker image is built and how the application is run.

### 1. Preparing the Image: The `Dockerfile`

The `Dockerfile` is a blueprint that contains all the commands and instructions needed to build a Docker image. Think of it as an automated script for setting up the application's environment from scratch. It handles everything from installing the operating system and dependencies to copying your application code.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   **Specifies a base image:** What operating system and pre-installed tools to start with (e.g., `node:18-alpine`, `python:3.10-slim`).
*   **Installs dependencies:** Runs commands to install necessary packages (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
*   **Copies application code:** Moves your source code into the image.
*   **Exposes ports:** Declares which network ports the container will listen on.
*   **Defines the run command:** Sets the default command to execute when the container starts.

#### Example `Dockerfile` (for a Node.js application)

This example shows how to create an image for a typical Node.js web server.

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image.
# 'alpine' is a lightweight version, which results in a smaller final image.
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory inside the container.
# All subsequent commands (COPY, RUN, CMD) will be executed from this path.
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files first.
# This leverages Docker's layer caching. If these files don't change,
# Docker won't re-run 'npm install' on subsequent builds, speeding things up.
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the application's dependencies.
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application's source code into the working directory.
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000 to the outside world.
# This is the port the application will run on inside the container.
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the application when the container starts.
CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
```

**To build the image from this `Dockerfile`, you would run:**
```bash
# This command builds an image and tags it with the name 'my-app'
docker build -t my-app .
```
*(Note: You usually don't need to run this command manually when using Docker Compose, as it handles the build process for you.)*

### 2. Running the Application: The `compose.yml` File

The `compose.yml` (or `docker-compose.yml`) file is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. While a `Dockerfile` builds a single image, a `compose.yml` file orchestrates multiple services (containers), networks, and volumes together to form a complete application stack.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   **Defines Services:** Each service corresponds to a container (e.g., a web server, a database, a caching layer).
*   **Builds or Pulls Images:** It can either build an image from a local `Dockerfile` or pull a pre-built image from a registry like Docker Hub.
*   **Configures Networking:** Automatically creates a network for all services, allowing them to communicate with each other easily using their service names (e.g., the `web` service can connect to the `db` service at `http://db:5432`).
*   **Manages Environment Variables:** Injects configuration and secrets without hard-coding them.
*   **Sets up Volumes:** Persists data (like a database) so it isn't lost when a container is stopped or removed.

#### Example `compose.yml` (for a web app and a database)

This file defines two services: `web` (our Node.js app from the `Dockerfile` above) and `db` (a PostgreSQL database).

```yaml
# Specify the Docker Compose file format version.
version: '3.8'

# Define all the services (containers) that make up the application.
services:
  # The 'web' service for our application.
  web:
    # Build the image from the Dockerfile in the current directory ('.').
    build: .
    # Map port 8000 on the host machine to port 3000 in the container.
    # You will access the app via http://localhost:8000.
    ports:
      - "8000:3000"
    # Mount the current directory on the host to /usr/src/app in the container.
    # This allows for live code reloading during development.
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src/app
      - /usr/src/app/node_modules # Exclude node_modules from being overwritten by the host
    # Define environment variables needed by the application.
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db:5432/mydatabase
    # Make the 'web' service depend on the 'db' service.
    # This ensures the 'db' container starts before the 'web' container.
    depends_on:
      - db

  # The 'db' service for our PostgreSQL database.
  db:
    # Use an official PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub.
    image: postgres:14-alpine
    # Define environment variables to configure the PostgreSQL database.
    # These are required by the postgres image.
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
    # Mount a volume to persist the database data.
    # 'db-data' is a named volume managed by Docker.
    # Data will be saved even if the container is removed.
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

# Define the named volumes used by the services.
volumes:
  db-data:
```

**To run the entire application stack defined in this file, you would run:**
```bash
# Start all services in the background (-d for detached mode)
docker-compose up -d
# Or with the newer syntax:
docker compose up -d

# To stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes:
docker-compose down
# Or with the newer syntax:
docker compose down
```
